      <h3>All about Kristen</h3>
    <p>Kristen Jaymes Stewart was born to Jules Mann and John Stewart in Los Angeles, California. She also has an older brother, Cameron. Her father was a stage manager and television producer and her mother was a script supervisor.
       Her family transferred to Colorado, where they lived for several years before they moved back to Los Angeles. At the age of eight, she was noticed by a talent scout agent during a Christmas play, who offered her a non-speaking role in a Disney TV movie titled, ‘The Thirteenth Year’. Thus, her tryst with acting began.</p><br>
       <p>Her prolific acting skills from a very young age went on to inspire a number of young girls and teenagers alike. 
          She was spotted by a talent scout and despite landing a small role in the Disney series, 
         ‘The Thirteenth Year’, she made her presence felt with a stunning, non-verbal performance. </p>
